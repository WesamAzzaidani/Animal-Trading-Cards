			<p id="description">The cat is a small carnivorous mammal.
				It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and
				often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild
				members of the family.Like all felids, domestic cats are
				characterized by supple low-slung bodies, finely molded heads, long
				tails that aid in balance, and specialized teeth and claws that adapt
				them admirably to a life of active hunting. Cats possess other features
				of their wild relatives in being basically carnivorous, remarkably agile
				and powerful, and finely coordinated in movement.</p>
